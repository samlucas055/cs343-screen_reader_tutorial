        <h4>How to Navigate Screen Reader Friendly Website</h4>
        <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/narrator/">WebAIM</a>
        <p>WebAIM is a screen reader friendly website. Activate Narrator, then press the tab key and then the enter key
            to skip to main content. Then, press the tab key
            to navigate through the links in the table of contents. Next, use the down arrow key to have Narrator read
            the next group of text to you. Narrator
            will read text until it encounters a link or the end of the paragraph, whichever happens first. To read text
            further up the page, press the up arrow
            key until you reach the text you want Narrator to read.

        <h4>How to Navigate a Screen Reader Not-So-Friendly Website</h4>
        <p>Some websites are not so friendly when using a Screen Reader. For example, Black Sheep Coffee, a local coffe
            shop in Harrisonburg has a website for their customers to view. However, when you go to access it using a
            Screen Reader, it isn't the most efficient. Here is a step by step tutorial of trying to navigate Black
            Sheep Coffee's website.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on Navigator.</li>
            <li>Go to <a href="http://www.blacksheepcoffeehburg.com/">Black Sheep Coffee</a></li>
            <li>Navigate through the page using tab or your hotkey of choice.</li>
            <li>As you will notice when you first tab through the page it will take you to two links that are positioned
                at the top of the page. They are links to download applications, but unfortunately, it doesn't describe
                it as so.</li>
            <li>Next, you will be directed to the header of the page which outlines the website for you as links.</li>
            <li>As you continue to tab through the content of the page, it will take you to several more links, many of
                which do not have a description.</li>
            <li>The website has a lot of lovely photos, however, most of them don't have figure descriptions to be read
                to the user.</li>
            <li>As you will eventually find out by navigating through the page, you will never get to the main content.
                This is poor design for a Screen Reader because customers will never be able to reach important
                information about the coffee shop.</li>
        </ol>
